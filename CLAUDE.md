- Here is how to orchestrate our processes among our agents: tdd-test writer should take any requirements and write tests -> -laravel-backend-engineer should write any and all backend related code -> ux-frontend-engineer should write any and all frontend related code -> code should be run against the TDD tests until it passes -> product-manager-ux-reviewer should look at what has been built and ensure it solves the right problems -> finally, code-reviewer reviews what has been built to ensure best practices
- Only keep one Laravel and one Vite dev server running at any given time. Do not start new servers on new ports while leaving existing servers running.
