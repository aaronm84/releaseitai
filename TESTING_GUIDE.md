# Laravel Application Testing Guide for ReleaseIt.ai

This directory contains comprehensive test files designed to validate a Laravel 11 application setup for ReleaseIt.ai. These tests follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and will initially **fail** until a proper Laravel application is installed and configured.

## Overview

The test suite validates the fundamental requirements that any Laravel application must fulfill for ReleaseIt.ai:

1. **Application Structure** - Ensures proper Laravel directory structure and files
2. **Database Setup** - Validates database connection and migration capabilities
3. **Authentication Foundation** - Tests session-based authentication system
4. **Core Routes** - Verifies essential endpoints (/dashboard, /workstreams, /releases)
5. **Environment Configuration** - Validates Redis and AWS S3 configuration

```

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make the test runner executable (if not already)
chmod +x run-tests.sh

# Run all tests with detailed output
./run-tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Test Laravel application structure
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/LaravelApplicationStructureTest.php

# Test database connectivity and migrations
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/DatabaseConnectionTest.php

# Test authentication foundation
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/AuthenticationFoundationTest.php

# Test core endpoints
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/CoreEndpointsTest.php

# Test environment configuration
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/EnvironmentConfigurationTest.php

# Test configuration validation
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/ConfigurationValidationTest.php
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Laravel Installation
- **All tests will FAIL** - This is expected and correct behavior
- Tests define the contract that the Laravel application must fulfill
- Failures clearly indicate what needs to be implemented

### After Laravel Installation
- Tests should progressively pass as Laravel is properly configured
- Any remaining failures indicate missing configuration or setup issues

## Setting Up Laravel 11

To create a Laravel 11 application that will pass these tests:

```bash
# Install Laravel 11
composer create-project laravel/laravel:^11.0 .

# Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Setup database
php artisan migrate

# Install Laravel Breeze for authentication (recommended)
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install blade
npm run build
```

## Test Categories Explained

### 1. Laravel Application Structure Tests
**File**: `tests/Feature/LaravelApplicationStructureTest.php`

**Purpose**: Validates that Laravel is properly installed with correct directory structure, files, and basic configuration.

**Key Validations**:
- Laravel 11.x is running
- Essential directories exist (app, config, database, etc.)
- Core files are present (artisan, composer.json, routes, etc.)
- Service providers are registered
- Middleware is configured
- Storage directories are writable

### 2. Database Connection Tests
**File**: `tests/Feature/DatabaseConnectionTest.php`

**Purpose**: Ensures database connectivity, migration system, and basic table structure.

**Key Validations**:
- Database connection configuration exists
- Can establish database connection
- Can execute basic SQL queries
- Migration files exist and can run
- Core tables (users, sessions, password_reset_tokens) are created correctly
- Database can be rolled back

### 3. Authentication Foundation Tests
**File**: `tests/Feature/AuthenticationFoundationTest.php`

**Purpose**: Validates session-based authentication system foundation.

**Key Validations**:
- Authentication configuration supports session-based auth
- User model exists and implements required contracts
- Authentication guards work properly
- Password hashing is configured
- User factory can create test users
- Login/logout functionality works
- Remember me functionality is available

### 4. Core Endpoints Tests
**File**: `tests/Feature/CoreEndpointsTest.php`

**Purpose**: Ensures essential routes exist and have proper access controls.

**Key Validations**:
- Route files exist and are loaded
- Core routes exist: /dashboard, /workstreams, /releases
- Authentication is required for protected routes
- Guest routes (login, register) work properly
- Route names are properly defined
- Middleware is correctly applied
- CSRF protection is enabled

### 5. Environment Configuration Tests
**File**: `tests/Feature/EnvironmentConfigurationTest.php`

**Purpose**: Validates configuration for required external services.

**Key Validations**:
- Environment files exist and are readable
- Redis configuration is properly set
- Redis connection can be established
- AWS S3 configuration exists
- Cache, session, and queue support Redis
- Mail and logging configuration exists
- Environment variables are loaded

### 6. Configuration Validation Tests
**File**: `tests/Unit/ConfigurationValidationTest.php`

**Purpose**: Unit tests for configuration structure and security settings.

**Key Validations**:
- All required configuration keys exist
- Configuration has proper structure
- Security settings are configured
- No placeholder values remain

## Configuration Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Application
APP_NAME=ReleaseIt
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:... # Generated by php artisan key:generate
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

# Database
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=releaseit
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

# AWS S3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

### Required Services
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Database server
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **AWS S3**: File storage (configured but may not be tested in local environment)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Laravel application not found"**
   - Install Laravel 11 in the current directory
   - Run `composer install` to install dependencies

2. **Database connection failures**
   - Ensure database server is running
   - Check database credentials in `.env`
   - Run `php artisan migrate` to create tables

3. **Redis connection failures**
   - Install and start Redis server
   - Check Redis connection settings in `.env`

4. **Authentication tests failing**
   - Install Laravel Breeze: `composer require laravel/breeze --dev`
   - Run `php artisan breeze:install blade`

5. **Route tests failing**
   - Ensure routes are properly defined in `routes/web.php`
   - Check that authentication middleware is applied

### Skipping External Service Tests

Some tests can be skipped if external services aren't available:

- Redis tests will be skipped if Redis isn't running
- S3 tests will be skipped if AWS credentials aren't configured

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow Laravel testing conventions
2. Use descriptive test names that explain behavior
3. Include Given-When-Then comments for clarity
4. Group related tests in appropriate test classes
5. Add proper assertions with descriptive failure messages

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Laravel Tests
  run: |
    php artisan config:clear
    php artisan cache:clear
    vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
```

The test suite ensures that any Laravel application deployed will have the fundamental requirements needed for ReleaseIt.ai functionality.
